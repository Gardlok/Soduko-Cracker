# Soduko-Cracker
Solve Soduko puzzles using various algorithms

THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPENT AND NOT READY FOR USE 

The purpose of this project is to practice GUIs with Kivy as well as functional 
algorithms and general app development workflow.

The goal is to be able to insert pythonic algorithms that take a soduko puzzle and
return a solution while being timed and monitored. This will provide information that
can be used to help optimization. A leader board would be cool. 

Each algorithm will take the same input and must return a solution in the same format.
The input/output format will be a list of 9 strings, each containing 9 characters. Each
string represents a row in the soduko grid. The input strings will have "?" in place 
where there are blank cells in the puzzle. The application will check the solution
to ensure it follows the rules of soduko.
